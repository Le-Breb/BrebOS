<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction üóíÔ∏è

### What is it ?

BrebOS is a hand made x86 32 bits OS made for learning and fun!
It is designed to work under QEMU, but it can also be used on real computers ! (It properly boots, though driver errors
are likely to occur because i did not add support for the specific hardware of the machine used, so do not try it).<br>
BrebOS is written in C++ and ASM_x86.

### Creation process

I realized the setup of the kernel thanks to https://littleosbook.github.io/. Then, I used the developper's best friend,
Google, and more
particularly the os developper's best friend, https://wiki.osdev.org/. Those two friends combined with passion and
determination ended up creating *BrebOS* :D!

## Installation üî®

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following packages, using `sudo apt install package_name`:

- **make** | build system
- **nasm** | ASM compiler
- **gcc** | C compiler
- **g++** | C++ compiler
- **mtools** | DOS disks utilities
- **xorriso** | ISO manipulator
- **qemu-system-i386** | Emulator
- **dnsmasq** | DHCP server

You also need a **Cross compiler**: Please refer to [this page](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler), and follow
the instructionns on sections 2 and 3. <br>
The build takes several minutes, don't forget to enable parallelization: whenever you execute the `make` command, add
`-j $(lscpu | grep 'Core(s) per socket' | grep -o '[0-9]+')` at the end of the command.

For QEMU, you need a few more setup:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/qemu # Create config directory
echo "allow br0" | sudo tee /etc/qemu/bridge.conf # Write the config
sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep /usr/lib/qemu/qemu-bridge-helper # Give necessary permissions to QEMU bridge helper
```

### Build

This step assumes you fulfilled all the requirements aforementioned.

You simply need to run:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/opt/cross/bin:$PATH"
RELEASE=1 make
```

### Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```sh
RELEASE = 1 make run
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è This will ask for elevated privileges, which are required for setting up NAT. ‚ÑπÔ∏è

## What can I do with BrebOS ‚ùì

### Commands

Now that you have the kernel up and running, you can start executing commands. The kernel uses a shell made as a school
project (42sh, made in groups of of 4 students), that I adapted to make it work in BrebOS. <br>
The shell language is a subset of the linux one. You should be able to use every basic shell syntax that exists in
linux, provided that (1) it does not require heavy kernel support that i did not add yet (redirections for example)
and (2) that the keyboard driver lets you type the characters you need üòÜ. For example, to date, you cannot type '$'
nor '(', so say bye bye to variables and subshells üò¢ <br>
Here is the list of the main commands (you can view the entire list by browsing at `BrebOS/src/programs`):

| Command                      | Description                                                                                    |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `q`                          | Quit (Shutdown).                                                                               |
| `ls <path>`                  | Lists files and directories at `path`.                                                         |
| `mkdir <path/dir_name>`      | Creates the directory `dir_name` at `path`.                                                    |
| `touch <dir_path/file_name>` | Creates the file `file_name` at `dir_path`.                                                    |
| `cat <path>`                 | Prints the content of the file at `path`. Output is formatted according to the file extension. |
| `clearscreen`                | Clears the screen                                                                              |

As 42sh follows the linux shell syntax, you can start a program symply by typing `<program_path> [argv0] [argv1] ...`.
The kernel `$PATH` is filled with `/bin`, where all programs are. Hence, to start `/bin/a_program`, simply write
`a_program`.

### Running your own programs inside BrebOS (How cool is this !?)

BrebOS can run C++ programs that *you* write, provided they respect the following conditions:

- Your program cannot use `dynamic_cast`, nor exceptions. They require additional support which i did not setup.
- You cannot make use of any library, even `libc`, as it is not ported on `BrebOS`. The only exception is my custom
  `libc`. The relevant headers are located under
  `src/libc`. For example, if you want to use `printf`, simply write `#include <kstdio.h>`. Generally speaking, most
  widely used headers of the linux libc have an equivalent which is the usual name preceded by 'k' (`stdio.h` <->
  `kstdio.h`) - though, inevitably, i did not implement every function inside it.
- Any other C++ feature (supposedly) works!

To add your program, simply follow the following steps:

- Copy your source files under `BrebOS/src/programs/your_awesome_program_name` <br>
  That's all! Yep, you've read well, there's nothing else you have to do! The Makefile will handle the compilation of
  your program and will add it at `/bin` in BrebOS' disk. <br>
  You can now run your program using `your_awesome_program_name` in BrebOS.

### Network

If you have knowledge in networking, you can play with network stuff. VM uses NAT to talk with the outer world. For
host-VM communication, host PC has IP 192.168.100.1, and the VM dynamically gets its IP from dnsmasq, a DHCP server
running locally, which is automatically started when executing `make run`.

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

### Core

- **Segmentation** (GDT setup)
- **Paging** (PDT, page tables)
- **Interrupts** (IDT)
- **Dynamic memory allocation** (malloc, free)

### Processes

- **Userland** (processes run in ring 3, kernel in ring 0)
- **Preemptive scheduling**
- **Syscalls**
- **ELF support**
    - ELF loading and execution (ELf processing, address space setup, global/local static variables handling)
    - Dynamic libraries support (relocations)
    - Lazy binding support (addresses of functions within dynamic libraries are resolved at runtime by `dynlk`, the OS'
      dynamic linker)
    - Custom libc (basic functions such as `strlen` and syscalls wrappers)
- **File System**
    - ATA driver (taken from osdev.com, not implemented by me)
    - FAT32 support
    - VFS which abstracts hardware/file_system specific details and provide a unified interface within the kernel.
- **Network stack**
    - E1000 ethernet card driver (mainly taken from [here](https://wiki.osdev.org/Intel_Ethernet_i217))
    - Ethernet
    - IPV4
    - UDP
    - ICMP ping reply
    - ARP
    - DHCP
    - TCP (weak for now)
    - HTTP GET
- **42sh (Shell**)
    - command lists/compound lists
    - if/else
    - single quotes
    - comments
    - while/until/for
    - and or (&& ||)
    - double quotes and escape character (though the keyboard driver does not handle '"'...)
    - variables
    - builtins
        - true/false
        - echo
        - continue
        - break
    - the following features are implemented within 42sh but BrebOS lacks support for them to work:
        - redirections
        - pipeline
        - subshells and command substitution

### Misc

- PS2 Keyboard driver

### Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

Those are things I'm willing to do. To not mistake it with things *I will* do.

- **Multithreading**
- **Multi core**
- **Bootloader**
- **C++ RTTI and exceptions support**

- **Drivers** <br>
  Add various real-life hardware drivers to be able to fully use BrebOS on real machines.
  For now, the kernel only works with the specific hardware emulated by QEMU.
